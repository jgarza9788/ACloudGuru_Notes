* The video discusses virtualization and its connection to containerization.
* Virtualization provides a way to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
* Type 2 hypervisors are software-based and run on top of an existing operating system.
* Hypervisors provide virtual hardware to guest operating systems, which run on top of them.
* Type 1 hypervisors, also known as bare metal hypervisors, run directly on the server hardware.
* Containers are a form of operating system virtualization that utilizes shared Linux kernels for isolation.
* Containers provide a middle ground between fully chrooted environments and traditional virtual machines.
* Containers allow for quick creation of isolated environments, as they share the same Linux kernel.
* Windows containers cannot run in Linux environments due to differences in kernel, but technology is evolving.

# Container Workflow


* The video introduces the topic of containers and their importance.
* It highlights the progression of the Container Essentials series, starting from the history of containers to various concepts like chroot, namespaces, cgroups, and operating system-level virtualization.
* The video emphasizes the benefits of containers, such as efficient resource utilization and rapid environment creation.
* It discusses the role of the Linux kernel in containerization and how containers make system calls to the kernel.
* The use of security technologies like SELinux and AppArmor for confining containers is mentioned.
* The video concludes by providing an overview of the containerization process, from user interaction to kernel interactions and security mechanisms.
The video offers a comprehensive understanding of containers, their components, and their interaction with the Linux kernel.


# LXC (Linux Containers):

* LXC, or Linux Containers, is an open-source technology for operating system-level virtualization.
* It allows you to run multiple isolated Linux environments (containers) on a single Linux host.
* LXC provides a lightweight and efficient way to create, manage, and run these containers.
* Containers created with LXC share the host's kernel but have their isolated user spaces, making them efficient and resource-friendly.

# LXD:

* LXD is a container management system and a high-level interface for LXC.
* It provides a more user-friendly and feature-rich experience for working with containers compared to LXC's command-line interface.
* LXD enables the orchestration of containers, making it easier to create, manage, and deploy them.
* It includes features like clustering, snapshots, image management, and RESTful API support.
* LXD simplifies container administration and is suitable for both single hosts and large container clusters.


# LXD and LXC usage

* Linux containers, often referred to as LXC or Lexy, are a technology for OS-level virtualization.
* Developed in 2008, they make use of Linux containment features like cgroups, namespaces, and chroot.
* LXC allows users to create and manage isolated Linux environments (containers) on a single Linux host.
* LXD is the Linux daemon that provides a more user-friendly interface and management tools for LXC containers.
* To get started with LXC and LXD:
    * Install LXD and LXD client packages (lxd and lxd-client).
    * Initialize LXD with sudo lxd init, configure storage, network, and choose options.
    * Use lxc launch to create containers from existing images.
    * lxc list shows the list of containers.
    * lxc exec allows you to enter a container and execute commands inside it.
    * Remotes like images.linuxcontainers.org host public container images that you can use.
    * Use lxc image list to list available images on your system.
* Containers provide isolated environments where you can run applications independently from the host system.

```bash

cat /ect/issue

sudo apt install lxd lxd-client
# install (via ubuntu)

sudo xld init
#start lxd

# set up storage 
# no network
# config lxd bridge
# yes yes 
# use defaults

lxc list
# confirms it is working

lxc launch ubuntu:16:04
# this causes error ^typo

lxc launch ubuntu:16.04
# see container

lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 my-ubuntu
# make a container with custom name

lxc list
# see containers

lxc launch images:alpine/3.5 my-alpine
# this is a remote, similar to repo

lxc list 
# see containers

lxc exec my-ubuntu -- /bin/bash
# you are now in ubuntu
# use whoami
exit
# exit ubuntu

lxc exec my-alpine -- /bin/ash
# now in alpine linux
whoami

echo hello > hi.txt
# make a file
cat hi.txt
# shows "hello" from file
exit
# exit alpine linux

ls
# no file

lxc exec my-ubuntu -- /bin/bash
ls
exit

lxc exec my-alpine -- /bin/ash
ls
# hi.txt file is here
exit 

lxc remote list
# shows all the images on the system

lxc images list
# shows a list of running images

```


# build your own adventure


* Learning about container technologies is like embarking on a journey.
* The journey involves understanding container basics, terminology, and usage.
* At this point, you have reached a fork in the road, where you can choose your next steps.
* For those who want to delve deeper into containers, a Deep Dive course on LXC and LXD is recommended.
* In the Deep Dive course, you will create containers, run web applications, and explore more advanced container concepts.
* However, if your goal is to grasp the essentials and understand the container world, you can continue by learning about Docker, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos.
* There is no wrong decision, and you can always revisit different paths in your container journey later.
* Close this video and embark on your chosen container adventure.


# Installing LXC/LXD
## Introduction
This lab will allow you to practice installing LXC/LXD in a cloud server environment. You will pull down the latest Alpine image and create a container from it to test your configuration.

## Solution
Log in to the lab server using the credentials provided on the hands-on lab page:

```bash
ssh cloud_user@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
```

ssh cloud_user@54.162.161.52  
8*ggCI-X

## Install the LXD Package
Determine which Linux distribution your server is running:
```bash
cat /etc/issue
```
Install lxd and lxd-client:

```bash
sudo apt install lxd lxd-client 
```
When prompted, enter the password provided on the lab page and hit Enter.

## Initialize LXD
Initialize LXD:

```bash
 sudo lxd init
``` 
Accept the defaults for each of the prompts, except for configuring IPv6. Select No when prompted to set up an IPv6 subnet.

## Create Your First Container
Create a container using Alpine 3.14 named my-alpine:

```bash
 sudo lxc launch images:alpine/3.18 my-alpine
```

List your containers:

```bash
 sudo lxc list 
```

## Connect to a Container
Execute an ash shell in your my-alpine container:

```bash
 sudo lxc exec my-alpine -- /bin/ash
```

Create a file named hello.txt:

```bash
 echo hello world! > hello.txt
```

Type ls to see the file, or (optionally) type cat hello.txt to see the content of the file .

## Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
