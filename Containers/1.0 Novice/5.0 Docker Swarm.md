# Docker Swarm

* Docker swarm is the topic of discussion.
* It's important for managing container orchestration.
* Helps automate and manage container deployments at scale.
* Can pool resources of multiple computers into a cluster.
* Features a manager node that assigns tasks to worker nodes.
* Offers a decentralized design for building swarms.
* Provides a declarative service model to define application stacks.
* Allows scaling based on desired states.
* Uses desired state reconciliation to adapt to changes.
* Supports multi-host networking with overlay networks.
* Offers service discovery with DNS names for containers.
* Enables load balancing of services.
* Prioritizes security with TLS encryption and authentication.
* Supports rolling updates for efficient deployments.


## features of Docker Swarm:

### Cluster Management
Docker Swarm provides integrated cluster management with the Docker engine, making it easy to create and manage a swarm using familiar Docker CLI commands.
### Decentralized Design
It handles node roles and specifications during runtime, enabling you to build an entire swarm from a single disk image.
### Declarative Service Model
Docker Swarm allows you to define the desired state for your application stack declaratively, simplifying the deployment process.
### Scalability
You can easily scale the number of running applications based on your desired state, and Docker Swarm automatically manages container allocation.
### Desired State Reconciliation
The swarm manager constantly monitors the cluster for differences between the actual and desired states, ensuring that the environment matches your specifications.
### Multi-Host Networking
Docker Swarm supports overlay networks for services, and the swarm manager assigns addresses to containers on these networks.
### Service Discovery
Each service in Docker Swarm is assigned a unique DNS name by the swarm manager, making it simple to query and access containers within the swarm.
### Load Balancing
You can expose ports for services to an external load balancer, and internally, Docker Swarm distributes containers among nodes to balance the workload.
### Security
Docker Swarm enforces TLS mutual authentication and encryption for secure communication between nodes. It supports self-signed or custom root certificates.
### Rolling Updates
Docker Swarm allows you to specify rollout times for updates, enabling you to monitor updates on one node at a time and roll back to a previous version if issues arise.


## Docker Swarm Overview

Here's a summary of the key points from the Docker Swarm video:

1. Introduction to Docker Swarm:

Docker Swarm is discussed as a container orchestration tool.
Mention of why Docker Swarm is used for managing containers at scale.

2. Environment Setup:

The presenter is logged into four different servers: a manager and three worker nodes.
Instructions on how to set up a Docker Swarm environment with these nodes.
Explanation of the docker swarm init and docker swarm join commands for initializing the swarm and adding worker nodes.

3. Node Roles:

Manager nodes control the swarm and handle tasks like creating services.
Worker nodes execute tasks assigned by the manager but don't have access to swarm management commands.
Reference to the historical term "slave nodes" for worker nodes.

4. Creating Services:

Introduction to the concept of Docker services, which define tasks and container images.
Use of docker service create to deploy services.
Example of creating a service with two replicas running an Nginx container.

5. Scaling and Load Balancing:

Discussion of scaling services to multiple replicas.
Explanation of how Docker Swarm distributes containers among nodes to balance the workload.
Use of docker service ps to view running tasks and their assignments.

6. Accessing Services:

Services in a Docker Swarm can be accessed through any manager or worker node, thanks to the swarm's built-in load balancing.

7. Fault Tolerance:

A demonstration of the swarm's fault tolerance capabilities.
The presenter intentionally shuts down servers and shows how the swarm reschedules tasks to maintain the desired state.

8. Conclusion:

Recap of the benefits of using Docker Swarm for container orchestration.
Encouragement for viewers to explore further Docker Swarm functionality.
The video provides an overview of Docker Swarm and demonstrates how to create services, scale them, and ensure fault tolerance in a swarm environment.




# cheatsheet for Docker Swarm commands:

**Initializing a Docker Swarm**

*   `docker swarm init`: Initialize a new Docker Swarm on the current node (manager).
*   `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>`: Initialize a new Swarm specifying the advertise address.

**Joining Nodes to a Swarm**

*   `docker swarm join-token worker`: Get the token to join a worker node to the Swarm.
*   `docker swarm join-token manager`: Get the token to join a manager node to the Swarm.
*   On worker nodes: `docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:<PORT>`: Join a worker node to the Swarm.
*   On manager nodes: `docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:<PORT>`: Join a manager node to the Swarm.

**Listing Nodes**

*   `docker node ls`: List all nodes in the Swarm, showing their status and availability.

**Creating and Managing Services**

*   `docker service create --replicas <REPLICAS> --name <SERVICE-NAME> <IMAGE>`: Create a new service.
*   `docker service ls`: List all services running in the Swarm.
*   `docker service ps <SERVICE-NAME>`: List tasks (containers) associated with a service.
*   `docker service scale <SERVICE-NAME>=<REPLICAS>`: Scale a service to a specified number of replicas.
*   `docker service update <SERVICE-NAME> --image <NEW-IMAGE>`: Update a service to use a new container image.
*   `docker service rm <SERVICE-NAME>`: Remove a service from the Swarm.

**Accessing Services**

*   Services are accessible via any node in the Swarm, thanks to built-in load balancing.

**Viewing Service Logs**

*   `docker service logs <SERVICE-NAME>`: View logs for a service.

**Inspecting a Service**

*   `docker service inspect <SERVICE-NAME>`: Display detailed information about a service.

**Promoting a Node to Manager**

*   `docker node promote <NODE-ID>`: Promote a worker node to a manager node.

**Demoting a Manager to Worker**

*   `docker node demote <NODE-ID>`: Demote a manager node to a worker node.

**Leaving the Swarm**

*   On worker nodes: `docker swarm leave`: Leave the Swarm.
*   On manager nodes: `docker swarm leave --force`: Forcefully leave the Swarm (use with caution).

**Updating Tokens**

*   `docker swarm join-token --rotate worker`: Rotate the worker join token.
*   `docker swarm join-token --rotate manager`: Rotate the manager join token.

**Removing Nodes**

*   `docker node rm <NODE-ID>`: Remove a node (manager or worker) from the Swarm.

**Draining a Node**

*   `docker node update --availability drain <NODE-ID>`: Put a node into "drain" mode to gracefully stop its tasks.

**Global Services**

*   `docker service create --mode global <SERVICE-NAME> <IMAGE>`: Create a global service (one instance per node).

**Rolling Updates**

*   `docker service update --image <NEW-IMAGE> <SERVICE-NAME>`: Perform a rolling update of a service.

**Rollback Service Update**

*   `docker service rollback <SERVICE-NAME>`: Rollback a service update to the previous version.

These commands should help you manage Docker Swarm efficiently, whether you're initializing a new Swarm, creating services, scaling them, or maintaining the cluster. Be sure to replace placeholders like `<SERVICE-NAME>`, `<REPLICAS>`, `<NEW-IMAGE>`, `<TOKEN>`, `<MANAGER-IP>`, `<NODE-ID>`, and `<PORT>` with specific values as needed.
