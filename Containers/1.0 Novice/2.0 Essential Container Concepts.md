# Container History 

* The history of containers dates back to the 1970s when mainframe computers became accessible but expensive.
* Centralized computing and virtualization technologies emerged during this period.
* The `chroot` command, introduced in 1979, marked the first steps towards containerization.
* In the 1990s, Bill Cheswick explored chrooted environments and created an isolated environment, similar to a chrooted jail, for security research.
* R and D Associates, a shared hosting company, sought to isolate customer environments, leading to the development of FreeBSD's jail command.
    * Chroot on steroids
* In 2006, Google introduced process containers, later known as cgroups, enabling resource control for groups of processes.
* The University of Berkeley's Nexus project used cgroups and later became known as Mesos.
* Google's open-source project "Let Me Containerize That For You" contributed to Docker's development in 2013.
* Docker's release allowed packaging and moving containers easily, and Docker Swarm emerged for cluster management.
* In 2014, Google open-sourced Kubernetes, influenced by its Borg system.
* Kubernetes was initially code-named Project Seven, inspired by a Borg character called Seven of Nine.
* Kubernetes became a powerful container orchestration tool.

# Chroot

* The chroot command changes the apparent root directory of a process, creating a limited view of the file system.
* It allows the creation of a chrooted environment, isolating processes from the rest of the system.
* This isolation can be useful for creating restricted environments for users, such as SFTP users or web developers.
* The demonstration involves creating an "Arkham jail" with user "Harlequin" and controlling the commands accessible within the chrooted environment.
* Libraries required for commands like ls and bash are copied into the chrooted environment's lib64 directory.
* A sample file is created within the chrooted environment.
* The tutorial showcases how a chrooted SSH environment can be set up for users with specific access restrictions.
* Restarting the sshd service and assigning a password for the user enable SSH access to the chrooted environment.
* The demonstration concludes by illustrating the isolated environment accessible to the SSH user "Harlequin."
* This tutorial provides hands-on guidance for using the chroot command to create isolated environments, particularly for SSH users, demonstrating its practical applications.

# Quickstart Guide for the chroot Command

The chroot command is a powerful tool in Linux and Unix-like operating systems that allows you to change the apparent root directory for a process, creating a limited environment within which commands run. Here's a quickstart guide to get you started:

1. Open a Terminal:

Launch your terminal emulator. You'll need a terminal with administrative (sudo) privileges to use chroot.
2. Create a Directory for Your Chroot Environment:

Decide on a name for your chroot environment, e.g., /mychroot, and create a directory for it:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mychroot
```
3. Populate the Chroot Environment:

To make the chroot environment functional, you'll need to populate it with essential files and directories. Typically, you'll want to copy or link binaries, libraries, and configuration files into your chroot.
Example: Copying the bash binary into the chroot:

```bash
sudo cp /bin/bash /mychroot/bin/
```

Note: You may need to copy additional libraries and configuration files depending on the specific purpose of your chroot environment.

4. Mount Necessary Filesystems:

Certain directories like /proc, /dev, and /sys may need to be mounted within the chroot environment to ensure that commands work correctly. Use the mount command for this purpose.
Example: Mounting /proc:


```bash
sudo mount -t proc proc /mychroot/proc
```
5. Change Root Using chroot:

Now, you can use the chroot command to switch into your chroot environment. You'll also need to specify the new root directory and the shell or command you want to run inside the chroot.
Example: Entering the chroot environment and starting a new shell:

```bash
sudo chroot /mychroot /bin/bash
```

6. Inside the Chroot:

You are now inside your chroot environment. Any commands you run will be isolated within this environment, and it will appear as if the chroot's root directory is the root of the filesystem.
7. Exiting the Chroot:

To exit the chroot environment and return to your host system, simply type exit:
```bash
exit
```
8. Cleanup:

After you're done with the chroot environment, unmount any mounted filesystems and remove the chroot directory:
```bash
sudo umount /mychroot/proc   # Unmount proc
sudo rmdir /mychroot         # Remove the chroot directory
```

## Important Notes:

Be cautious when using chroot, as it can be a powerful tool with security implications.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and backups before creating or modifying chroot environments.
Chroot environments are isolated from your host system, but they are not completely secure. It's not suitable for robust containerization or security isolation, and more advanced tools like Docker or virtual machines may be better options for certain use cases.
This quickstart guide provides a basic overview of how to use the chroot command. Depending on your specific needs and use case, you may need to customize your chroot environment further.

# linux Namespaces
limits a process's see/access to system resources


## PID Namespace (pid): 
This namespace isolates the process ID (PID) number space. Each PID namespace has its own unique set of process IDs, making processes within it appear as if they are running in their private process tree.

## Network Namespace (net): 
Network namespaces isolate network-related resources, such as network interfaces, routing tables, firewall rules, and sockets. Processes in different network namespaces can have their network stacks and network configurations.

## Mount Namespace (mnt): 
Mount namespaces provide isolation for file system mounts. Each mount namespace has its own view of the file system hierarchy, allowing different processes to have separate mount points and mounts.

## UTS Namespace (uts): 
UTS namespaces isolate the system hostname and NIS (Network Information Service) domain name. Each UTS namespace has its own hostname, making it appear as if it has its own system identity.

## IPC Namespace (ipc): 
IPC namespaces isolate inter-process communication mechanisms like System V IPC objects (shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphores). Processes within different IPC namespaces cannot interact with the IPC resources of other namespaces.

## User Namespace (user): 
User namespaces allow mapping user and group IDs inside the namespace to different IDs outside the namespace. This is crucial for containerization, as it provides a level of privilege separation.

## Cgroup Namespace (cgroup): 
Cgroup namespaces were introduced more recently and provide isolation for control groups. They allow processes to be isolated into their separate control group hierarchies.

# Network Namespace


In this video, Ell Marquez from linuxacademy.com provides a practical example of using network namespaces to demonstrate what namespaces can achieve in Linux. Here's a summary of the key points:

* Namespaces in Linux provide isolation for various system resources, allowing processes to operate in isolated environments.
* The example focuses on network namespaces, but there are other types of namespaces for different resources.
* The ip netns command is used to create and manage network namespaces. In this case, a network namespace named "sample1" is created.
* The sudo command is used to execute commands within the network namespace, and ip netns exec is used to specify the namespace and the command to execute.
* The iptables -L command is used to list the IP table rules for the host system, and it requires sudo because it accesses privileged information.
* Within the network namespace, IP table rules are configured to allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
* Exiting the network namespace, the video shows that these rules don't affect the host system's IP table rules, demonstrating the isolation provided by namespaces.

The video emphasizes that namespaces are a fundamental concept in containerization and provide a way to isolate resources for different processes or containers. Namespaces, along with other concepts like cgroups, play a crucial role in containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

```bash

sudo ip netns add sample1
sudo ip netns list 

sudo iptables -L

# ... 

sudo ip netns exec sample1 iptables -L
#[use the sample1 namespace] [^execute the iptables command]


sudo ip netns exes sample1 bash
#[use the sample1 namespace] [^execute bash]
#this would be in the sample1's root

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -L

exit

sudo iptables -L


```

# Control Group 
aka Process Container

* Control Groups, also known as cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that isolates a process's access to system resources, providing resource management and limiting capabilities.
* Originally, cgroups were called "process containers" by Google but were later renamed to cgroups to avoid confusion with full-fledged containers.
* Cgroups are sometimes referred to by different names, including "control groups," "subsystems," and "resource controllers," but the core concept remains the same.
* The first version of cgroups, cgroups v1, was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.24. Subsequent developments led to the creation of cgroups v2 in Linux kernel 3.10.
* Both cgroups v1 and v2 are used concurrently in many systems because older systems rely on v1, while newer systems can take advantage of v2.
* Cgroups allow processes to have different resource isolation rules, and each subsystem can have its own hierarchy, which can be independent of others.
* Various cgroups subsystems are supported by the Linux kernel, each designed for specific resource management:
    * blkio: Controls and limits I/O access for groups of processes.
    * cpu: Monitors and limits CPU usage by processes, with weight-based allocation.
    * cpuacct: Generates automatic reports on CPU resource usage.
    * cpuset: Pins groups of processes to specific CPUs.
    * devices: Manages access to devices for processes within a cgroup.
    * freezer: Suspends or resumes tasks within a cgroup.
    * memory: Monitors and controls memory usage at the page level.
    * net_cls: Tags network packets with class identifiers for traffic control.
    * net_prio: Sets the priority of network traffic for each network interface.
    * Additional subsystems can be created based on specific needs.
* Cgroups provide fine-grained control over system resources and resource tracking, which is essential for managing containerized environments effectively.
* The video emphasizes that while understanding the details of each subsystem may not be necessary, grasping the core concept of how cgroups isolate and manage resources is essential.
* Control groups play a crucial role in enabling resource isolation and allocation in containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.
* The hugetlb subsystem is briefly mentioned as an example of a cgroups subsystem designed to manage large memory pages efficiently.
* Cgroups give administrators the ability to limit and manage processes' resource consumption effectively.
* The video suggests that viewers may need to review the content multiple times to fully grasp the concept of cgroups and their subsystems.
* The primary takeaway is that cgroups isolate processes' access to system resources, and the subsystems provide a way to fine-tune this resource management.
* Viewers are encouraged to continue their learning journey with this foundational knowledge of cgroups.
