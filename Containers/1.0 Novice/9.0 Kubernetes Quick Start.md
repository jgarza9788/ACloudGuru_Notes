# What Is Kubernetes, and Why Do I Need It?

* The video introduces Kubernetes and its significance.
* Kubernetes is compatible with any open container initiative-compliant containerization framework, but the example in the video uses Docker.
* Docker assigns IP addresses to containers, and these IP addresses can be the same, causing issues with container communication.
* Kubernetes addresses the problems Docker IP assignments create:
    * Kubernetes has a master node and worker nodes.
    * The smallest unit in Kubernetes is a Pod, which holds an IP address. All containers in a Pod share the same IP.
    * Pods can contain one or more containers, and all Pods in a cluster share the same IP space.
    * Containers within Pods and nodes can communicate with each other easily.
    * Kubernetes uses network overlays (e.g., Flannel, Weave Net, Istio) for IP management.
    * Cluster state is managed by kubelet running on all nodes.
* The video outlines upcoming topics, including the installation of a Kubernetes cluster, creating Pods, DNS, network overlays, and services.
* The video emphasizes that while it provides a Quick Start overview, more in-depth courses are available for those interested in deeper Kubernetes knowledge.

# Master and Nodes

*The video discusses the components running on Kubernetes master and worker nodes.
*On the master node:
    *etcd is the key-value store for cluster objects.
    *The API server handles instructions and communication with kubectl.
    *The scheduler determines the best node to deploy Pods based on resource usage.
    *The controller manager oversees various controllers such as node controller, replication controller, etc.
*On worker nodes:
    *kubelet manages the Kubernetes service on the node.
    *The container runtime (e.g., Docker) instantiates containers when needed.
    *kube-proxy handles service exposure and port forwarding.
    *A network overlay (e.g., Flannel) is responsible for networking between Pods.
*The master node hosts most of the Pods, while worker nodes are lightweight.
*Pods are containerized within Docker namespaces.
*Kubernetes uses Docker containers under the hood to manage deployments, replica sets, and other objects.
*The video provides insights into the architecture of Kubernetes and how it interacts with Docker.

# Orchestration

# Pods and Containers

Here's a summary of the key points from the video about Pods in Kubernetes:

* A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
* A Pod can contain one or more containers.
* All containers in a Pod share the same IP address and port space.
* Containers within a Pod can communicate with each other using localhost.
* Pods can have shared volumes for data sharing between containers.
* Kubernetes uses YAML files to define Pod specifications.
* Kubernetes is declarative in nature.
* Containers within a Pod require a continuous command to keep the Pod running.
* An example demonstrated how to create a Pod with two containers sharing a volume.
* The concept of shared volumes allows containers in a Pod to easily share data.
* The video emphasized the importance of having a continuous command to keep the Pod running.
* A successful example showed communication between containers within a Pod using the shared volume.
* The video teased the next topic, DNS, which will be covered in the following video.
These key points provide an overview of Pods in Kubernetes and their essential characteristics and usage.

```bash

kubectl get namespace
#gets the namespace

kubectl create namespace podexcample
#creates a namespace

cat ./pod-example.yml
#shows the yml file
# the specs of the pod

vim ./pod-example.yml
# edit the yml

kubectl create -f ./pod-example.yml
# created podexample

kubectl --namespace=podexample get pods
kubectl --namespace=podexample get pods
kubectl --namespace=podexample get pods
# shows pods... pods without commands will shutdown

kubectl --namespace=podexample delete pod examplepod
# delete pod

vim ./pod-example.yml
# edit back to keep the pod running

kubectl --namespace=podexample get pods -o wide

curl <ipaddress> 
# gets the dates from the shared volume

```

# Networking


Here's a summary of the key points from the video about networking in Kubernetes with a focus on Flannel:

* Flannel is the networking solution being used in Kubernetes for the demonstration.
* Flannel is a simple networking solution suitable for getting started quickly with Kubernetes.
* Flannel operates as a CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin.
* It does not provide network policy enforcement, making it straightforward to use.
* Flannel runs a small agent called "flanneld" on each host, allocating subnet leases.
* Network configuration is stored in etcd and passed via the Kubernetes API.
* Flannel works at Layer 3, providing an overlay network for containers.
* Each node, including the master, runs the Flannel agent.
* Flannel sets up routing tables to enable communication between containers and nodes.
* Flannel's dynamic IP allocation is essential for flexible and elastic scaling in Kubernetes.
* DNS services depend on Flannel's network configuration, so it must be available before nodes become "ready."
* Core DNS servers are assigned IP addresses within the Flannel network.
* Kubernetes relies on etcd for maintaining state and IP address assignments.
* Networking plays a critical role in ensuring the flexibility and resiliency of Kubernetes clusters.
* Other network overlays like Istio, Weave Net, and Calico offer more advanced features and network policy enforcement.
* For the quick start, Flannel is chosen due to its simplicity and ease of use.
* The video teases the next lesson, which will cover DNS in Kubernetes.

These key points provide insights into Flannel's role in Kubernetes networking and the significance of network configuration in cluster operation.


# DNS


Here's a summary of the key points regarding DNS in Kubernetes from the video:

* DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical component in Kubernetes for enabling communication between Pods and services.
* DNS plays a vital role in allowing Pods to resolve the IP addresses of other Pods and services within the cluster.
* DNS is particularly important for ensuring that when Pods are replaced or scaled, communication can still occur seamlessly.
* DNS records are automatically generated for Pods, services, and other objects in the cluster.
* Each Pod can search for DNS records within its own namespace and resolve service names to IP addresses.
* DNS server configuration is handled by Kubernetes, and Pods are configured to use the cluster's DNS service.
* The DNS server schedules a DNS Pod within the cluster to provide DNS resolution.
* The contents of a Pod's /etc/resolv.conf file show the DNS configuration set by the kubelet when the container is instantiated.
* PodSpec policies determine how a container uses DNS, such as using the cluster's DNS, preferring cluster DNS but allowing hostnames, or opting to not use DNS and communicate explicitly using IP addresses.
* DNS is a fundamental component that ensures the flexibility and resilience of Kubernetes clusters, allowing seamless communication between Pods and services.
* In future lessons, DNS will be further explored in the context of service discovery and load balancing.
* Understanding DNS is crucial for maintaining connectivity and service availability in Kubernetes clusters.

These key points provide insights into the role of DNS in Kubernetes and its importance for maintaining communication within the cluster.

# replicaSets

Here's a summary of the key points about ReplicaSets in Kubernetes from the video:

* A ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes resource that manages a set of identical Pods, ensuring that a specified number of replicas are running at all times.
* ReplicaSets are defined using YAML or JSON manifests that specify the desired number of replicas, container images, and other configurations.
* Pods managed by a ReplicaSet share common labels, and the ReplicaSet uses label selectors to identify and manage these Pods.
* ReplicaSets are responsible for ensuring that the actual number of Pods matches the desired number of replicas. If Pods fail or are deleted, the ReplicaSet automatically replaces them to maintain the desired state.
* ReplicaSets provide a level of fault tolerance and high availability by ensuring that a specified number of Pods are always running, even if some fail.
* You can scale a ReplicaSet by changing the number of desired replicas using the kubectl scale command.
* ReplicaSets can be created and managed using Kubernetes resources, and they are represented as rs or replicaset in resource definitions.
* ReplicaSets are suitable for ensuring the availability of stateless applications. For stateful applications, StatefulSets or other controllers may be more appropriate.
* ReplicaSets lack some advanced deployment features, making them less commonly used in favor of Deployments, which provide more control over rolling updates and versioning.
* To clean up resources created by a ReplicaSet, you can use the kubectl delete command followed by the name of the ReplicaSet.

These key points provide insights into what ReplicaSets are, how they work, and their role in ensuring the desired number of Pods are running within a Kubernetes cluster.


```bash

kubectl create -f ./replicas-example.yml
# creates the replicas

kubectl get pods
#gets the pods

kubectl describe rs/frontend
# get's info
# and events

kubectl get pods
#get pods

kubectl describe pods <podname>
#get the info on this pod

curl <ipaddress>

kubectl scale re/frontend --replicas=4
# makes 4 replicas

kubectl scale re/frontend --replicas=1
# removes 3 pods and leaves 1

kubectl delete rs/frontend
# delete replicas

```


# services

Here's a summary of the key points about services in Kubernetes from the video:

* Services in Kubernetes provide a way to group and expose a set of Pods as a network service.
* They act as a load balancer and a proxy to forward network requests to the appropriate Pods.
* Services ensure that Pods remain abstracted and can be scaled or replaced without affecting the clients.
* A service definition includes labels and selectors to determine which Pods to include, ports for external access, and target ports for the Pods.
* Services use kube-proxy to manage network routing and load balancing for Pods.
* When creating a service, you specify the selector that matches the labeled Pods to include in the service.
* Services have cluster IP addresses that can be used for internal communication within the cluster.
* DNS is used for service discovery, allowing Pods to find services using their DNS names.
* Scaling ReplicaSets or deployments automatically updates the service endpoints to include new Pods.
* Services provide high availability and fault tolerance by distributing network requests among multiple Pods.
* Services are valuable for connecting frontend and backend components, ensuring smooth communication even with Pod changes or scaling.

These key points offer an understanding of what services are, how they work, and their significance in managing communication between Pods and external clients in Kubernetes.


```bash

kubectl create -f ./replicas-example.yml
kubectl get pods
# create pods

kubectl describe pod <podname>
#gets info

cat ./service-example.yml
#shows the service yml

kubectl create -f ./service-example.yml
#creates a service

kubectl describe service my-awesome-service
#gets info for service

kubectl create -f ./dnstestpod.yml
# creates a utility pod

kubectl exec -it testbox /bin/bash
# gets into the dnstestpod

nslookup my-awesome-service
#gets the address of the service

curl <ipaddress>

kubectl scale re/frontend --replicas=4
# scale

kubectl describe service my-awesome-service
#gets info (more endpoints)

```


# deployment

* Deployments in Kubernetes are used for managing and updating sets of Pods.
* They define an update strategy that ensures high availability during updates.
* Deployment manifests include metadata, selectors, ReplicaSets, and a Pod template.
* The selector labels determine which Pods are controlled by the deployment.
* Deployments provide a rolling update strategy to minimize downtime during changes.
* The rolling update strategy is defined by parameters like maxUnavailable and maxSurge.
* Kubernetes ensures a minimum readiness period before considering Pods as updated.
* To create a deployment, you can use kubectl create with the deployment manifest file.
* Deployments maintain a specified number of replicas, allowing scaling and updates.
* Services can be used in conjunction with deployments to access Pods externally and load balance traffic.
* Updating a deployment involves changing the image version, and Kubernetes ensures a smooth transition.
* Kubernetes performs rolling updates, scaling old and new Pods as needed, and maintaining availability.
* Deployments are valuable for managing and updating applications without downtime in Kubernetes clusters.

These key points offer an understanding of what deployments are, how they work, and their significance in managing and updating applications within Kubernetes.

```yml

CHAPTER 2.6
Deployments


In this lesson, we will look at creating a Deployment. We will see how we can use Deployments to manage ReplicaSets. We will look at versioning our Deployments and how a Deployment will gracefully roll out those new versions.

deployexample.yaml:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment 
  labels: 
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx 
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: darealmc/nginx-k8s:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

```bash

kubectl create -f ./deployexample.yaml
# create pods

kubectl get pods
#shows pods

kubectl create -f ./service-example.yaml
# create service

curl <ipaddress:port>
# gets the html

kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/example-deployment nginx=darealmc/nginx-k8s:v2
# updates image

kubectl get deployment
# shows both pods are uptodate

kubectl describe deployment example-deployment 
# gets deployment info

curl <ipaddress:port>


```

# lab

Creating a Kubernetes Cluster
=============================

Introduction
------------

In this hands-on lab, we will install and configure a Kubernetes cluster consisting of 1 master and 2 nodes. Once the installation and configuration are complete, we will have a 3-node Kubernetes cluster that uses Flannel as the network overlay.

Logging In
----------

Use the credentials provided on the hands-on lab overview page to log into the master and server nodes as `cloud_user`. It's probably a good idea to have three terminals open, one for each node.


## 0 - Master
ssh cloud_user@18.234.180.67
l8est%aW

## 1
ssh cloud_user@3.94.208.30
l8est%aW


## 2 cloud
ssh cloud_user@54.242.44.216
l8est%aW

Install Docker and Kubernetes on All Servers
--------------------------------------------

Most of these commands need to be run on each of the nodes. Pay attention though. Down at Step 10, we are going to do a little bit on _just_ the master, and down at Step 15 we'll run something on _just_ the nodes. There are notes down there, just be watching for them.

1 - Once we have logged in, we need to elevate privileges using `sudo`:

`sudo su`

2 - Disable SELinux:

`setenforce 0 sed -i --follow-symlinks 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/sysconfig/selinux`

3 - Enable the `br_netfilter` module for cluster communication:

`modprobe br_netfilter echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables`

4 - Ensure that the Docker dependencies are satisfied:

`yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2`

5 - Add the Docker repo and install Docker:

`yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo`
`yum install -y docker-ce`

6 - Set the cgroup driver for Docker to systemd, reload systemd, then enable and start Docker:

```bash
sed -i '/^ExecStart/ s/$/ --exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=systemd/' /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable docker --now
```

7 - Add the Kubernetes repo:

`cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo [kubernetes] name=Kubernetes baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64 enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 repo_gpgcheck=0 gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg EOF`

8 - Install Kubernetes `v1.14.0`:

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
repo_gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg
  https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
EOF
```

`yum install -y kubelet-1.14.0-0 kubeadm-1.14.0-0 kubectl-1.14.0-0 kubernetes-cni-0.7.5`

9 - Enable the `kubelet` service. The `kubelet` service will fail to start until the cluster is initialized, this is expected:

`systemctl enable kubelet`

### Note: Complete the following section on the MASTER ONLY!

10 - Initialize the cluster using the IP range for Flannel:

`kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`

11 - Copy the `kubeadmn join` command that is in the output. We will need this later.

12 - Exit `sudo`, copy the `admin.conf` to your home directory, and take ownership.

```bash

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

13 - Deploy Flannel:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel-old.yaml`

14 - Check the cluster state:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`

### Note: Complete the following steps on the NODES ONLY!

15 - Run the `join` command that you copied earlier, this requires running the command prefaced with `sudo` on the nodes (if we hadn't run `sudo su` to begin with). Then we'll check the nodes from the master.

`kubectl get nodes`

Create and Scale a Deployment Using kubectl
-------------------------------------------

### Note: These commands will only be run on the master node.

16 - Create a simple deployment:

`kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`

17 - Inspect the pod:

`kubectl get pods`

18 - Scale the deployment:

`kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4`

19 - Inspect the pods. We should have four now:

`kubectl get pods`

Conclusion
----------

We got it done. We've created Kubernetes cluster, and deployed Nginx on it. Then we scaled up to four pods. Congratulations!
