# Install Docker on Ubuntu

Note: This demo was created using an Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish cloud server. 

1. Ensure no old versions are present on the system:

sudo apt remove -y docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

2. Ensure your apt package index is up to date, then upgrade your packages:

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

3. Use the Tab key to toggle between fields and acknowledge any prompts.

4. Install the following apt packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

5. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

6. Set up the repository:

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

7. Update the apt package index:

sudo apt update -y

8. Install Docker Community Edition:

sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
 
9. Use the Tab key to toggle between fields and acknowledge any prompts.

10. Confirm Docker installed correctly:

sudo docker run hello-world

11. For best practices, do not use the root user. Instead, add your user to the Docker group:

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

12. Run the command to activate the new group membership immediately:

newgrp docker

13. Verify you can now run the 'docker' command without 'sudo'.

docker run hello-world

The video covers Docker port concepts, how to run containers with different port mappings, and how to access containerized services both internally and externally. It encourages further learning for a deeper understanding of Docker ports.

```bash

docker container ls
docker images ls

docker container run -d nginx
#run image deattached

docker container ls

docker container history
# see the history of an container

docker container inpect 06 | grep IPAdd
# shows the IP of this container

elinks <ipaddress>
# links to this container - like website

docker container run -d -P nginx
#                        ^ maps any ports (random)

docker container ls

docker container run -d -p 80:80 nginx
#                          ^ map port 80 to port 80

docker attach <containerId>
# in container

curl -4 icanhazip.com
# gives the ip of the box
elinks <ip>

```

# Docker volumes 


* Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by a container.
* They work on both Linux and Windows containers.
* Volume drivers can be used to store volumes remotely or in the cloud.
* You can pre-populate volumes with data from a container.
* To list existing volumes, use the docker volume ls command.
* Create a new volume with docker volume create <volume-name>.
* Use the --mount flag or -v flag to mount a volume into a container.
* Docker 17.06 onwards allows you to use the --mount syntax for standalone containers.
* Stopping and removing a container doesn't delete the associated volume data.
* You can attach an existing volume to a new container to access the stored data.

A Docker volume is a feature in Docker that allows you to persist and manage data used by containers. It provides a way to store and share data between containers, as well as between containers and the host system. Docker volumes are often used to:

## Persist Data: 
Volumes allow you to store data generated by containers even after the container is removed. This is useful for databases, logs, and configuration files, among others.

## Share Data: 
Multiple containers can share the same volume, making it easier to exchange information or configuration between them.

## Manage Data Separately: 
Volumes are separate from containers, which means you can back up, restore, or manage data independently of the containers that use it.

## Improved Performance: 
Volumes can be more efficient than using bind mounts for data persistence, especially in scenarios with large amounts of data.

Overall, Docker volumes provide a flexible and efficient way to handle data storage and sharing in Docker containers, making it an essential feature for many containerized applications.


```bash

docker volums ls
# list volume

docker volume create devvolume
# create a volume

docker volums ls
# list volume

docker container run -d --name devcont --mount source=devvolume, target/app nginx
# create a container and mount a volume in it

docker container ls

docker container inspect devcont
# shows the volume is in it (in mounts)

sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes
# shows what is inside volumnes

sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/devvolume
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/devvolume/_data

docker container exec -it devcont sh
# open container with shell

ls

echo "Hello!" >> /app/hello.txt
ls app

exit

sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/devvolume/_data

docker container stop devcont 
docker container rm devcont 

sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/devvolume/_data

docker container run -d --name devcont2 -v devvolume:/app nginx
# run a container with mounting devvolume to /app

docker container exec iit devcont2 sh
ls

# hello.txt is there
cat /app/hello.txt

echo "GoodBye" >> /app/bye.txt

sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/devvolume/_data

```




Working with Docker Images
==========================

Introduction
------------

Time to put your Docker image skills to the test! In this lab, you will use your newfound knowledge of Docker images to pull, build, and launch containers.

Solution
--------

1.  Begin by logging in to the lab server using the credentials provided on the hands-on lab page:
    
    `ssh cloud_user@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS`
    
ssh cloud_user@54.221.102.178
fQfs1u=0

### Pull the Latest Alpine Image

1.  Pull the latest `alpine` image from Docker Hub:
    
    `docker image pull alpine:latest`
    
2.  Confirm it is there with:
    
    `docker images`
    

### Pull the Latest `httpd` Image

1.  Pull the latest `httpd` image:
    
    `docker pull httpd:latest`
    
    > **Note**: If you don't put the version, the latest version is assumed.
    

### Pull nginx 1.15

1.  Pull nginx version 1.15.
    
    `docker pull nginx:1.15`
    
2.  Confirm that it is there:
    
    `docker images`
    

### Compare the History

1.  Look at the history for both the `httpd` and `nginx` images:
    
    `docker history httpd`
    
2.  Note the following command gives an error because the latest version is assumed:
    
    `docker history nginx`
    
3.  When you specify the right version, the command succeeds:
    
    `docker history nginx:1.15`
    

Conclusion
----------

Congratulations — you've completed this hands-on lab!
